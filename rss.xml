            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Impossible Project's first instant camera has an app with full manual controls</h1><p>The Impossible Project is best known for keeping Polaroid's type 600 instant film format alive even after it was abandoned by the long-time camera maker in 2008.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Assignment of a Lifetime: Riding in a U-2 Spy Plane at the Edge of Space</h1><p>Back in 2010, San Francisco-based photographer Christopher Michel received a once-in-a-lifetime photo assignment from the US Navel Institute: to ride in the back seat of a U-2 spy plane at the "edge of space." At the plane's cruising and intelligence-gathering altitude of 70,000 feet above the ground, temperatures outside the plane fall to 70 degrees below zero.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/04f6c0633f5a485f90dde99e96cd653a67f86bd6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3sixteen + Herman Miller</h1><p>LES-based raw denim fiends 3sixteen advocate skilled craftsmanship and longevity-which is why they often post photos of their customers' faded, worn-in jeans after years of use. Thus, their special collaboration with design manufacturer Herman Miller makes perfect sense, as there's a shared commitment to inspiring through timeless, dependable design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f04a92fd70ba0596ea6b8079424cfee8970ec89c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
